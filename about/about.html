            <h2>graphic designer</h2>
            <h3>hi, i'm elvia</h3>
            <p>I am a graphic designer based in California with a focus in branding and marketing. I have worked on a
                variety of projects including print, packaging and web design. I have a passion for all things design
                and love being able to solve problems while still having the opportunity to be creative. I also have a
                background in psychology, which I believe helps me better understand people and their needs. I dabble in
                other things beyond graphic design, including makeup, embroidery and
                doodling.</p>
