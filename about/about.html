            <h3>hi, i'm elvia</h3>
            <p>I am a graphic designer based in California with a focus in branding and marketing. I have worked on a
                variety of projects including print, packaging and web design. I have a passion for all things design
                and love being able to solve problems while still having the opportunity to be creative.</p>
            <p>I also a background in psychology, which I believe helps me better understand people and their needs</p>
            <p>I also love dabbling in other things beyond graphic design, which include makeup, embroidery and
                doodling.</p>
