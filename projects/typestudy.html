            <h3>type study</h3>

            <p>For this piece, I was assigned a typeface and asked to make a poster based off it. I was asked to include
                the alphabet, and numbers as well as some special characters. I had to also highlight some key features
                of the typeface, which in this case was the Q.</p>
