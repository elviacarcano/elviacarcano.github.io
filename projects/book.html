            <h3>book design</h3>
            <p>For this piece, I was assigned to redesign Paul Randâ€™s Design and the Play Instinct. I was given only the
                images and text and was told to design the book in a way that was both visually aesthetic, but readable.
                I decided to go with a more classic look by using a serif font and I also tried to make some of the
                pages more interesting by playing with the color and movement of some of the images.</p>
